This GitHub repository contains 8 python files.

1. Cam_Code.py

2. Cell_Detect.py

3. Edge_Detection.py

4. Full_Cell_Detection_Code.py

5. Hist_Contrast_Test_Code.py

6. Image_Coordinates_V2

7. New_Res_Img

8. samplescan.v2.py

The most imporant file of all of these scripts is the "Full_Cell_Detection_Code.py"
file. This file contains all of the code necessary to scan a set grid of images of
your microscope. 

All of the other files contain the pieces of code that were necessary to create
this master file. As such these files are a bit messier and contain less
documentation.

In general if you want to run any of the files contained in this GitHub repository
you will need to change the "file_pathing" statements in the code since these are
unique to each computer.

And of course all necessary libraries that are imported in the file you want to
run will need to be installed.

In general it's best to run these files with Python 3.8

Good luck!
